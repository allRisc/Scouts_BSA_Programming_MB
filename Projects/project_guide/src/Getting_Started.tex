\chapter{Getting Started}
\label{chap:getting_started}

  As discussed in \autoref{sec:where_to_start} I strongly recommend using the provided
    Virtual Machine (VM) for this merit badges.
  Doing so allows for the following notable advantages:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item No Installations necessary
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All of the tools necessary for any project have been pre-installed on the VM
    \end{itemize}
    \item Guaranteed Compatibility
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All of the projects for this merit badge have been verified to work on the VM
    \end{itemize}
    \item Easier to Follow
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All of the instructions and examples in this project have been designed with the VM in mind
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}

  The remainder of this chapter is spent allowing for install and a quick guide to the operating system.

  \section{Installing VM Software}

  \section{Importing the Programming Merit Badge VM}
  \label{sec:import_merit_badge_vm}

  \section{Getting Familiar with the VM}
  \label{sec:getting_familiar_with_vm}

    When you first start the VM you will be greeted with a login screen.
    The username and password for the VM can be found below:

    \mdfsetup{
      innertopmargin=12pt,
      linecolor=green!75,
      linewidth=2pt,
      topline=true,
      frametitleaboveskip=\dimexpr-\ht\strutbox\relax,
      nobreak=true
    }

    \vspace{5pt}
    \begin{mdframed}[]
      \textbf{Username:} scoutsbsa

      \textbf{Password:} \texttt{goodturn} 
    \end{mdframed}

    Enter the password and you will be see the home screen.
    In the upper left corner of the screen you should see \autoref{fig:desktop_view}

      \label{fig:desktop_view}
    \end{figure}

    \FloatBarrier

    There are several icons on this screen.
    The bar on the left contains all of the programs necessary for the projects in this merit badge.
    The top image is the \texttt{FireFox} web-browser (like Google Chrome, Safari, or Internet Explorer).
    One icon down is the file explorer which allows you to see the files on the VM.
    Below the file explorer is the terminal which allows you to compile and execute programs (see \autoref{fig:terminal_icon}).
    Finally, is the the VS Code icon (see \autoref{fig:vs_code_icon}).
    VS Code is a text editor which allows code to be highlighted so it is easier to read.

      \begin{subfigure}{0.4\textwidth}

        \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{./images/terminal.png}

      \caption{Program Icons}
      \label{fig:program_icons}
    \end{figure}

    Now click on the terminal open it.
    This will place you in your \textit{home} folder.
    Type the \texttt{ll} command to view a list of all the files and folders in your \textit{home}.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./images/home_file_list.png}
      \caption{Home Directory File List}
      \label{fig:home_file_list}
    \end{figure}

    \FloatBarrier

    Notice there is a folder called projects.
    This is where all of the files you will need for your projects live.
    To get there in the terminal type \texttt{cd projects}.
    The \texttt{cd} command changes the directory you are in.
    Now find a list of the files in the projects directory.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./images/projects_file_list.png}
      \caption{Project Directory File List}
      \label{fig:proj_file_list}
    \end{figure}

    \FloatBarrier

    Now we want to go into the into the \textit{hello\_world} folder.
    Again use \texttt{cd} to do this.

    Once in the \textit{hello\_world} folder view the two files using \texttt{ll}.
    Notice a file called \textit{Makefile}.
    This is the file which controls how all of your projects are run.
    Use the command \texttt{make} to view what it does in this folder.

    \begin{figure}[ht]
      \centering
      \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{./images/hello_world.png}
      \caption{Project Directory File List}
      \label{fig:hello_world_example}
    \end{figure}

    \FloatBarrier

    Now that you've seen how we are going to run our projects let's explore how we are going
      to change the code.
    Open the VS Code window by clicking on the VS Code icon on the left.
    The left hand side should contain a list of files and folders.
    At the top of this section the folder name which you are currently looking at 
      should be displayed.
    VS Code should have automatically opened to the \texttt{projects} folder.
    If not use \textit{File $\rightarrow$ Open Folder} to open the projects folder in your home directory.

    Now click the hello world folder on the left-hand bar.
    You should see the same two files we saw in the terminal.
    Click \texttt{hello\_world.py} to open the file.
    This file is extremely simple, so for now just change the "Hello World" message to another message of your choosing.
    Then rerun make in the terminal.
    You should now see your message displayed!

  \section{Next Steps}
  \label{sec:next_steps}

    Now you should be ready to go!
    Head on over to the \nameref{chap:project_a} chapter to get started.

    If you've had any troubles in this section let your councilor know before moving on.
